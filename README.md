1. Vyper is a pythonic programming language for smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). We aim to become a leading choice for smart contract development by offering superior developer experience, high quality tooling, maximum readability and security.

2. Vyper is already the second most widely used programming language on EVM chains. Our latest release (0.4.0) introduced composability via its module system and a new highly optimized backend (Venom). We worked to drastically increase security with full reviews of the codebase, regular audits, security competition and by working on compiler verification. These features allow Vyper to produce contracts that have 50% smaller bytecode size, lower gas costs and are significantly cheaper to audit compared to other smart-contract programming languages. Vyper's pythonic syntax also make it easy to onboard new developers to web3, as Python is now the most popular programming language (SO survey, 2024). A recent Twitter poll with 164 participants showed that a majority of developers would pick Vyper and Ape over Solidity and Foundry to start a new project.

3. Vyper regularly works with top auditors and security researchers to ensure the security of its codebase. We will use these connections to gather a pool of qualified auditors that we can connect with projects that build on Optimism and use Vyper as their smart contract language. In doing so we will help the Collective grow the number of active developers across the Superchain while driving adoption of Vyper.

4. Vyper stands out by being the only smart contract programming language prioritizing readability and security. Its backend (Venom) offers unmatched performance. We also innovate to improve developer experience, for instance by offering support for popular collaborative tools like Jupyter notebooks and Google Colab, allowing multiple developers to quickly and interactively iterate over their smart contract code.
5. Vyper is released under a permissive open source license (Apache)
6. Vyper is free for all users
7. Vyper can be used to interact with any other contract on Optimism, regardless of their programming language.
